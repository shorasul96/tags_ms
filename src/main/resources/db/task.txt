Write a spring boot microservice to manage the domain model Tags. The tags have the following model:
Tag:
- key: string
- value: string

The microservice should expose a REST API to list, add, delete, and update individual tags.
Please write unit and integration tests using junit5.
Use H2 as the database.

Please include a readme to facilitate running the microservice.
